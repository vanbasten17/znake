## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Central balance source

The system SHALL keep gameplay content selection rules in centralized, data-driven configuration rather than scene-local hardcoded lists.

#### Scenario: Spawn pools are data-driven

- **WHEN** gameplay resolves powerup/enemy variant selection policy
- **THEN** selection pools and weights are read from config modules
- **AND** scene code avoids inline hardcoded selection arrays for these systems
