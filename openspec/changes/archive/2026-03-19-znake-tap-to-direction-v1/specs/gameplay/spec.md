## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Snake movement

The system SHALL advance snake movement on a fixed interval and apply input with anti-reverse protection.

#### Scenario: Absolute swipe direction resolves to cardinal movement

- **WHEN** GameScene receives a swipe direction payload (`left`/`right`/`up`/`down`) from virtual input
- **THEN** it enqueues the requested cardinal direction
- **AND** enqueues direction through existing anti-reverse input logic
