## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Central feedback tuning

The system SHALL keep first-pass feedback timing and intensity values in centralized configuration.

#### Scenario: Damage and pickup feedback are config-driven

- **WHEN** flash duration, shake duration, hit-stop window, or related pickup/damage emphasis values are evaluated
- **THEN** the values come from centralized balance config
- **AND** scene code does not duplicate those timing constants inline

#### Scenario: Objective celebration feedback is config-driven

- **WHEN** reward-ready or objective-complete emphasis values are evaluated
- **THEN** the values come from centralized balance config
- **AND** celebration tuning can be iterated without editing multiple call sites
