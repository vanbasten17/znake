## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Snake body render continuity

The system SHALL render snake head and all remaining body segments in every frame where those segments exist.

#### Scenario: Head render does not abort tail render

- **WHEN** drawFrame renders the head segment
- **THEN** rendering continues for all remaining segments without exiting the full frame draw

#### Scenario: Tail is visible after movement

- **WHEN** snake length is greater than one
- **THEN** at least one non-head body segment is visible in the rendered frame

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Snake movement

The system SHALL move the player snake by one cell per tick in the current direction, with queued inputs allowing up to 2 direction changes between moves.

#### Scenario: Direction cannot reverse

- **WHEN** the user inputs opposite of current direction (e.g., right when moving left)
- **THEN** the input is ignored

#### Scenario: Snake grows when eating food

- **WHEN** snake head moves onto food cell
- **THEN** pendingGrowth increments and tail is not popped for that move

#### Scenario: Snake shrinks when not growing

- **WHEN** snake moves and pendingGrowth is 0
- **THEN** tail segment is removed
